This is a shameless copy - pythonization of a program written by https://github.com/armlabs/ssd1306_linux.git.
I converted this to python to incorporate in to a bigger project.
Also made a fontmaker for this which can generate fonts using a tkinter interface. These fonts can be directly added at the top of this script.
Font maker is here https://github.com/sxkod/fontmaker
Currently able to make 8x8 fonts and icons work well
Still trying to figure out how to make bigger fonts.
