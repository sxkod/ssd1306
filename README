This is a shameless copy - pythonization of a program written by https://github.com/armlabs/ssd1306_linux.git.
I converted this to python to incorporate in to a bigger project.
Also made a fontmaker for this which can generate fonts using a tkinter interface. These fonts can be directly added at the top of this script.
Font maker is here https://github.com/sxkod/fontmaker
Currently 8x8 fonts, 16x16 fonts and icons work well

SSD1306.py is for Raspberry Pi
xoled.py is for Micropython

Micropython example
--------------
from machine import I2C,Pin
bus=I2C(scl=Pin(5),sda=Pin(4),freq=100000)
import xoled
import Font_icox
xf=Font_icox.font
xoled.init(bus)
xoled.curfont=xf
xoled.write_string_tall("abcde")
